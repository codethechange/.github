# Code the Change Dot-Github Files

This repository contains default community health files for the
[Stanford Code the Change](codethechange.stanford.edu) organization. For
any given repository in this organization, if the repository does not
already define one of the files here, the file in this repo will be
used. For help, see
[this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization)
GitHub article.

## Overriding These Files

If you want to replace one of these default files with one specific to
your repository, just create it at the root of your repository. For
example, if you want to override the default `CONTRIBUTING` file, create
a `CONTRIBUTING` file at the root of your repository. That file will
then be used instead of the default one.
