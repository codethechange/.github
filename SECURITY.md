# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please DO NOT report vulnerabilities in a public GitHub issue or
unencrypted email!**

Please report any security issues you find to the project maintainers by
submitting a report via our web form:
[https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6W5wiPWpDiWsBTv](https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6W5wiPWpDiWsBTv).

We ask that you not reveal the vulnerability
to anyone until we have fixed and publicly disclosed it. We are happy to
give you credit on our README for reporting the bug once it is
disclosed, but we do not offer bug bounties.
